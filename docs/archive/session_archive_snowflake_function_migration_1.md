# Session Archive: Snowflake Function & dbt View Migration

**Date:** 2024-08-16
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Session Overview

This document archives the design and implementation process for a critical portion of the Apollo Analytics Snowflake migration project. The session focused on migrating complex PostgreSQL functions and dbt models, revealing crucial requirements related to transaction atomicity and real-time data needs that fundamentally shaped the architectural approach.

## 2. The Journey: From Flawed Assumptions to a Robust Solution

The session can be broken down into two primary workstreams, both of which followed a path of initial design, critical feedback, and successful correction.

### Workstream 1: The `publish_division_forecasts` Stored Procedure

-   **Initial Design (Flawed):** The first architectural design for migrating the complex forecast publishing logic proposed an **asynchronous** workflow using a Snowflake Task to sync data after the main transaction.
-   **Critical User Feedback:** The user identified this as a "dealbreaker." The application's front-end required the data sync to be **instantaneous and atomic** with the publication step to prevent users from seeing inconsistent or stale data.
-   **Revised Design (Successful):** A new, **synchronous architecture** was designed. It uses a primary stored procedure that wraps the entire promotion and data sync logic within a single transaction. The sync is handled by a helper procedure using a `MERGE` statement, ensuring atomicity and immediate data consistency.
-   **Outcome:** The superior synchronous design was implemented, documented in `docs/adr/003_forecast_publishing_synchronous_sync.md`, and the corresponding stored procedures were created.

### Workstream 2: The `mm_with_forecast_status` dbt View

-   **The Challenge:** Migrating a dbt view that relied on a PostgreSQL function (`get_valid_forecast_generation_month_date`) to dynamically fetch a date value at query time.
-   **Initial Design (Flawed):** The first proposal was to embrace a dbt-native pattern by materializing the function's output in an upstream dbt model.
-   **Critical User Feedback:** The user correctly pointed out that this violated a core requirement: the date value **must be "live"** to reflect real-time changes in market publication statuses. A materialized table would have unacceptable data latency.
-   **Second-Level Flaw (Syntax Error):** While pivoting to a UDF-based approach, the initial Snowflake script provided was syntactically a stored procedure, not a scalar UDF, a subtlety that was initially missed.
-   **Revised Design (Successful):** The procedural logic was correctly refactored into a **non-procedural, scalar Snowflake SQL UDF**. The dbt view was then updated to call this UDF, perfectly replicating the required "live" query-time execution of the original Postgres version.

## 3. Key Lessons Learned & Process Improvements

This session was invaluable for refining the migration process.

1.  **Primacy of Implicit Business Requirements:** The most critical requirements (atomicity, data freshness) were not explicit in the code but were core to the business logic. **Going forward, I will always explicitly probe for temporal constraints and transactional boundaries.**
2.  **Rigor in Platform-Specific Syntax:** There is a crucial difference between Snowflake Stored Procedures and UDFs. **I will now apply stricter validation to any provided code artifacts before integrating them into a design.**
3.  **The Power of Iterative Feedback:** Both major successes in this session were the direct result of correcting flawed designs based on precise user feedback. This highlights the value of the iterative `CREATIVE -> FEEDBACK -> REVISE` loop.

## 4. Final State

The key components of the forecast publishing and status viewing logic have been successfully migrated to Snowflake, with robust, synchronous, and performant designs that meet all identified business requirements.
