1. Alcohol Industry Framework
Three-Tier System:

Tier 1: Producers (Breweries, Wineries, Distilleries)

Tier 2: Distributors/Wholesalers

Tier 3: Retailers (Liquor Stores, Bars, Restaurants, Grocery)

Key Insight: Shipments flow Tier 1→2, depletions measure Tier 2→3 sales

2. Product Hierarchy
Copy
Category (Beer/Wine/Spirits)
  → Subcategory (Craft Beer/Champagne/Whiskey)
    → Brand (e.g., Brand X Cabernet)
      → Variant (750ml Bottle, 12oz Can)
        → Size Pack
          → SKU (Unique UPC/Product Code)
Size Classes: Standardized units (Case Equivalent = 9L)

ABV Tracking: Alcohol by volume required for tax calculations

3. Customer/Market Hierarchy
Copy
Region (Northeast US)
  → State (NY)
    → County (Onondaga)
      → Account Type (Off-Premise/On-Premise)
        → Account (Specific Bar/Store)
Channel Types:

Off-Premise: Retail stores (sold for consumption elsewhere)

On-Premise: Bars/restaurants (consumed onsite)

4. Key Metrics
Depletions: Distributor-to-retailer sales (true demand signal)

Shipments: Producer-to-distributor inventory movement

Days of Supply: (Distributor Inventory ÷ Avg Daily Depletions)

Price Tier: Luxury/Premium/Value segmentation

4a. Volume Context Matters:

Shipments Volume (Tier 1→2): Physical cases moved from producer (William Grant) to distributors

Example: 500 cases of Glenfiddich 15yr shipped to Southern Glazer's CA warehouse

Modeling: Raw cases_shipped + gross_revenue (wholesale pricing)

Depletions Volume (Tier 2→3): Cases sold through distributors to retailers

Example: 200 cases of same SKU sold to BevMo stores

Modeling: cases_sold + net_revenue (after distributor margins)

4b. Key Differences:

Aspect	Shipments	Depletions
Timing	Leading indicator	Lagging indicator
Financials	Wholesale $	Retail-equivalent $
Demand Signal	Production planning	Consumer demand
Tax Impact	Excise tax due	Sales tax accrual


5. Regulatory Factors
Tax Jurisdictions: Federal/state/county excise taxes

Compliance Flags: Dry counties, shipping restrictions

License Tracking: Permit numbers for distributors/retailers

6. Data Structure Examples
Fact Tables:

Depletions: Date, DistributorID, RetailerID, SKU, Units, $, ExciseTax

Shipments: Date, ProducerID, DistributorID, SKU, CasesShipped

Inventory: SnapshotDate, DistributorID, SKU, WarehouseQty

Dimension Tables:

Product: SKU, Size, ABV, Brand, Variant, Category

Accounts: AccountID, Name, Type (On/Off Premise), LicenseNumber

`Geography**: MarketID, State, County, TTBRegion

7. Hierarchy Relationships
Product Rollup: SKU → Variant → Brand → Subcategory → Category

Market Rollup: Store → County → State → Region → National

Customer Rollup: Individual Account → Chain → Parent Company

8. Temporal Considerations
Depletion Lag: Typically 4-6 weeks behind shipments

Seasonality: Key dates (July 4th, Super Bowl, December holidays)

Aging Tracking: Especially for whiskey/wine (barrel dates, vintage years)

9. Use Cases to Enable
Track depletion velocity of new SKU launches

Compare on-premise vs off-premise mix by region

Monitor distributor inventory days of supply

Audit tax compliance across jurisdictions

Analyze size trends (750ml vs 1L bottle performance)

10. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Mixing shipment (wholesale) with depletion (retail)

Missing ABC license expiration dates in compliance checks

Failing to normalize case sizes across product types

Overlooking franchise laws (exclusive distributor territories)

This context should help you:

Recognize alcohol-specific patterns in raw data

Build appropriate star/snowflake schemas

Establish correct aggregation paths

Flag regulatory requirements

Maintain proper temporal relationships

Forecasting Logic:
Forecasts will be generated based on historical trends, with options for users to select different time frames (e.g., 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, Flat).
The system will need to accommodate manual inputs for forecasts, allowing users to override automated predictions when necessary.
Saved versions of forecasts will be maintained, enabling users to track changes and compare against previous estimates.
User Experience Considerations:
The interface will allow users to filter data by market and SKU, providing a granular view of sales and inventory.
A dynamic table will display actual sales, forecasted numbers, and any manual adjustments made by users.
