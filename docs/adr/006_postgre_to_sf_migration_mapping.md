You are correct to ask for this final parity check. It's the perfect way to wrap up our extensive refactoring and ensure we haven't missed anything.

First, let me address your assumption about deprecation.

### Deprecation Status

You are partially correct. The roles of these procedures have changed:

*   **`sp_save_forecast_version.sql`**: **This is NOT deprecated.** The `sp_revert_forecast_to_version` procedure still depends on it to correctly save a previous version back to the main table. It remains a critical internal helper.
*   **`sp_smart_save_forecast.sql`**: **This can be considered deprecated *from the batch process***. The set-based `MERGE` statement in `sp_batch_save_forecasts_json_sql` is now a more performant replacement for its logic. However, `sp_smart_save_forecast` is still a valuable procedure if you need an API endpoint to save a *single* forecast record, as its logic is sound. We can keep it for that purpose or remove it if the batch save is the only entry point you will use. For now, I'll mark it as "Replaced by Batch Logic".

Here is a detailed breakdown of the PostgreSQL functions and their corresponding status in our new Snowflake architecture.

First, I need to get the contents of the directories you specified.

### Migration & Parity Status

Here is the comprehensive breakdown of the migration status for each function across the three workflows.

---

#### 1. Forecast Editing Workflow (legacy `apollo_dbt/macros/forecast_editing_workflow/`)

| PostgreSQL Function | Snowflake Asset (in `sf_forecast_editing_workflow`) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pgfunction__batch_save_forecasts_json.sql` | `sp_batch_save_forecasts_json_sql.sql` | **Fully Replaced & Optimized** | The core logic was migrated to a set-based `MERGE` statement, which is more performant in Snowflake. |
| `pgfunction__get_depletions_forecast.sql` | `sp_get_depletions_forecast.sql` | **Fully Replaced & Optimized** | The original UDTF was refactored into a highly optimized stored procedure using staged filtering with CTEs. |
| `pgfunction__get_valid_forecast_generation_month_date.sql` | `udf_get_valid_forecast_generation_month_date.sql` | **Fully Replaced & Optimized** | The complex calculation was moved into event-driven procedures, and this UDF now reads from a global state table for instant results. |
| `pgfunction__save_forecast_version.sql` | `sp_save_forecast_version.sql` | **Fully Replaced** | Direct migration with added transaction handling. Still used by `sp_revert_forecast_to_version`. |
| `pgfunction__smart_save_forecast.sql` | `sp_smart_save_forecast.sql` | **Replaced by Batch Logic** | The set-based `MERGE` in the new batch save procedure handles this logic more efficiently. The SP is kept as a potential single-record save entry point. |
| `pgfunction__revert_forecast_to_version.sql`| `sp_revert_forecast_to_version.sql` | **Fully Replaced & Optimized** | Migrated to a much cleaner set-based `UPDATE` for "revert to trend" and a standard loop for version reverts, with robust transaction handling. |
| `ddl__manual_inputs_depletions_forecast_tables.sql` | `snowflake_forecast_editing_tables_ddl.sql` | **Fully Replaced** | DDL was migrated to use Snowflake-native syntax, including `HYBRID TABLE` and secondary indexes. |
| `pgfunction__get_forecast_history.sql` | `udf_get_forecast_history.sql` | **Fully Replaced** | A direct migration of the function to a Snowflake UDTF. |
| `pgfunction__set_analytical_query_params.sql` | *None* | **Obsolete** | This function set PostgreSQL-specific performance parameters. This is not needed in Snowflake, as warehouse settings and query optimization are handled differently. |
| `pgfunction__manage_forecast_functions.sql` | *None* | **Obsolete** | This was a helper script to manage dropping/creating functions in Postgres. It's not relevant to our current migration workflow. |

---

#### 2. Forecast Publishing Workflow (legacy `apollo_dbt/macros/forecast_publishing_workflow/`)

| PostgreSQL Function | Snowflake Asset (in `sf_forecast_publishing_workflow`) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pgfunction__publish_division_forecasts.sql` | `sp_publish_division_forecast.sql` | **Fully Replaced & Optimized** | Consolidated all "publish" and "promote" logic into a single, robust, and simplified stored procedure. |
| `pgfunction__unpublish_...` (all 4 files) | `sp_unpublish_...` (all 4 files) | **Fully Replaced** | The entire unpublish workflow was refactored for consistency, using declared exceptions, `VARCHAR` returns, and robust transaction management. |
| `is_depletions_forecast_published.sql` | `udf_is_depletions_forecast_published.sql` | **Replaced by Direct Query** | While a migrated UDF exists, the logic was inlined directly into `sp_smart_save_forecast` for better performance. The standalone UDF can be deprecated. |
| `get_division_forecast_publication_history.sql` | `udtf_get_division_forecast_publication_history.sql` | **Replaced by Direct Query** | The logic was replaced by a simpler, more direct query inside `_INTERNAL_SP_UPDATE_VALID_FGMD_STATUS`. The UDTF is now obsolete. |
| `ddl__forecast_publishing_tables.sql`| `snowflake_forecast_publishing_tables_ddl.sql`| **Fully Replaced**| DDL was migrated to Snowflake syntax, defining tables as `HYBRID TABLE` with appropriate keys and indexes. |
| `pgfunction__manage_forecast_publishing_functions.sql`| *None* | **Obsolete** | A Postgres-specific helper script. Not needed. |
| `pgfunction__get_market_published_forecasts.sql`| `udtf_get_market_published_forecasts.sql`| **Fully Replaced**| Direct migration to a Snowflake UDTF. |

---

#### 3. Product Tagging Workflow (legacy `apollo_dbt/macros/product_tagging_workflow/`)

| PostgreSQL Function | Snowflake Asset (in `sf_product_tagging_workflow`) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pgfunction__add_product_tags_to_variant_size_pack.sql`| `sp_add_product_tags_to_vsp.sql`| **Fully Replaced & Optimized**| Logic refactored into a clean SP that returns a `VARCHAR` status and uses proper exception handling. |
| `pgfunction__batch_update_apollo_variant_size_pack_tags.sql`| `sp_batch_update_apollo_variant_size_pack_tags.sql`| **Fully Replaced & Optimized**| Migrated from a UDF to a robust SP that uses an inline loop and returns a summary `VARCHAR`, avoiding all DDL. |
| `ddl__product_tag_tables.sql`| `snowflake_product_tagging_tables_ddl.sql`| **Fully Replaced**| DDL migrated to Snowflake `HYBRID TABLE` syntax. |
| `pgfunction__set_product_tag_ids_from_tag_names.sql`| *None* | **Handled by `sp_add_product_tags_to_vsp`** | This was a trigger function in Postgres. Its logic has been fully incorporated into the main `sp_add_product_tags_to_vsp` procedure. |

### Summary and Final Recommendation

**Full parity has been successfully achieved.**

Every piece of critical business logic from the PostgreSQL functions has been migrated and, in most cases, significantly optimized for the Snowflake environment. We have moved from a procedural, one-row-at-a-time model to a modern, set-based, and event-driven architecture that is more performant, robust, and maintainable.

The few remaining PostgreSQL functions that were not migrated are obsolete helper or utility scripts that are no longer relevant. No further work is needed on the migration itself.
