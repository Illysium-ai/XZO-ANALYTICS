### Feature: Sync manual comments when promoting to a new Forecast Generation Month (FGMD)

- Trace ID prefix: R-1xx

#### EARS Requirements
- R-101: WHEN forecasts are promoted to 'consensus' for a given `P_CURRENT_FGMD` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL upsert next-month (`DATEADD(MONTH, 1, P_CURRENT_FGMD)`) rows in `FORECAST.MANUAL_INPUT_DEPLETIONS_FORECAST` with identical business keys and manual volumes.
- R-102: WHEN a new target row is inserted (NOT MATCHED) for the next FGMD THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL set `COMMENT` to the raw `source.COMMENT` value (no prefixes or annotations).
- R-103: WHEN an existing target row is matched AND the raw `source.COMMENT` differs from the current `target.COMMENT` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL update `target.COMMENT`, even if `MANUAL_CASE_EQUIVALENT_VOLUME` is unchanged.
- R-104: WHEN any change is applied to a target row (volume or comment) THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL increment `CURRENT_VERSION` by 1 and persist a version record in `FORECAST.MANUAL_INPUT_DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_VERSIONS` without creating duplicates.
- R-105: WHEN the source `COMMENT` is NULL or empty THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL set the target `COMMENT` to NULL (no autogenerated text).
- R-106: WHEN the sync is re-run idempotently for the same `P_CURRENT_FGMD` and divisions THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL avoid unnecessary updates and duplicate version rows.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- AC-101 (R-101,R-102,R-105): Given `P_CURRENT_FGMD='2025-07-01'`, `MARKET_CODE='USAIL1'`, `VARIANT_SIZE_PACK_ID='HE001-6-1000'`, and a non-null source comment, the inserted row for FGMD `2025-08-01` has a `COMMENT` equal to the exact raw source comment; if the source comment is NULL/empty, the target is NULL.
- AC-102 (R-103,R-104): If a target row already exists for `2025-08-01` with equal volume but a different comment from the computed auto-synced string, the MERGE updates `COMMENT` and increments `CURRENT_VERSION`, and a corresponding versions row is present.
- AC-103 (R-106): Re-running the sync without changes does not increment `CURRENT_VERSION` nor create additional versions rows.
- AC-104 (R-105): If the source comment is NULL/empty, the target `COMMENT` is NULL.

#### Notes
- Scope includes the base item table (`MANUAL_INPUT_DEPLETIONS_FORECAST`); chain table parity will follow in a later task if needed.
