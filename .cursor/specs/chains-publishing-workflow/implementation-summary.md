# Chains Publishing Workflow - Implementation Summary

## üéØ **Implementation Status: CORE COMPLETE**

The chains publishing workflow has been successfully integrated into the existing forecast publishing system. All core functionality is implemented and ready for testing.

## ‚úÖ **Completed Implementation**

### **1. Publishing Integration (sp_publish_division_forecast.sql)**

**Added chains publishing to consensus promotion in TWO locations:**

#### **For "All Divisions" Promotion (P_DIVISION IS NULL):**
- **Manual Chains:** Archive from `MANUAL_INPUT_DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_CHAINS` 
- **Draft Chains:** Archive from `DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_INIT_DRAFT_CHAINS` with primary method filtering
- **Logic:** Only publish chains when core volume promotes to consensus (not review)

#### **For "Specific Division" Promotion:**
- **Same logic** as above, filtered by specific division
- **Maintains transactional consistency** with core volume publishing

### **2. Unpublishing Integration**

#### **Division-Level (sp_unpublish_division_forecast.sql):**
- Added `DELETE FROM DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_PUBLISHED_FORECASTS_CHAINS` 
- Uses same `PUBLICATION_ID` filtering as core volume
- **Atomic operation** with core unpublishing

#### **Market-Level (sp_unpublish_market_forecast.sql):**
- Added `DELETE FROM DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_PUBLISHED_FORECASTS_CHAINS`
- Filters by market code and publication metadata
- **Maintains data consistency** across both modules

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Key Features Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Shared Publication Infrastructure** - Uses same `group_id` and `publication_id` as core
- ‚úÖ **Two-Source Publishing** - Manual + Draft chains forecasts (mirroring core behavior)  
- ‚úÖ **Consensus-Only Publishing** - Chains only publishes during consensus promotion
- ‚úÖ **Running Table Behavior** - Snapshots current chains state regardless of FGMD
- ‚úÖ **Primary Method Filtering** - Uses `DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_PRIMARY_FORECAST_METHOD_CHAINS`
- ‚úÖ **Parent Chain Fields** - Correctly handles `PARENT_CHAIN_CODE/PARENT_CHAIN_NAME`

### **Data Flow:**
```sql
Core Consensus Promotion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Update publications to 'consensus'
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Archive core manual forecasts  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Archive core draft forecasts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ú® Archive chains manual forecasts (NEW)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ú® Archive chains draft forecasts (NEW)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sync to next month
```

### **Error Handling:**
- **Transactional Safety** - All chains operations within same transaction as core
- **Rollback Protection** - If chains publishing fails, entire consensus promotion rolls back
- **Data Validation** - `NOT EXISTS` clauses prevent duplicate/orphaned records

## üìä **Implementation Statistics**

| **Procedure** | **Lines Added** | **Key Changes** |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `sp_publish_division_forecast` | ~120 lines | 2 chains INSERT statements per consensus path |
| `sp_unpublish_division_forecast` | ~10 lines | 1 chains DELETE statement |
| `sp_unpublish_market_forecast` | ~10 lines | 1 chains DELETE statement |
| **Total** | **~140 lines** | **6 chains operations total** |

## üß™ **Ready for Testing**

### **Test Scenarios to Validate:**
1. **Consensus Promotion:** Division with mixed manual/draft chains data
2. **Division Unpublishing:** Verify both core and chains records removed
3. **Market Unpublishing:** Verify market-specific chains cleanup
4. **Error Scenarios:** Verify rollback behavior if chains operations fail
5. **Performance:** Test with realistic data volumes

### **Validation Queries:**
```sql
-- Verify chains published with correct metadata
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FORECAST.DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_PUBLISHED_FORECASTS_CHAINS 
WHERE GROUP_ID = ? AND PUBLICATION_ID = ?;

-- Verify no orphaned chains records after unpublishing  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FORECAST.DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_PUBLISHED_FORECASTS_CHAINS c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM FORECAST.DEPLETIONS_FORECAST_PUBLICATIONS p 
    WHERE p.PUBLICATION_ID = c.PUBLICATION_ID 
    AND p.PUBLICATION_STATUS IN ('review', 'consensus')
);
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Execute Phase 4: Testing** (Tasks 4.1-4.3)
2. **Run integration tests** with sample data
3. **Validate performance** meets requirements (<30 seconds)
4. **Deploy to development environment** for stakeholder review
5. **Complete Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment**

## üîí **Rollback Strategy**

- **Simple revert** of stored procedure changes
- **No DDL changes** required (tables already existed)
- **Zero data impact** - only procedural logic changes
- **Independent rollback** possible for each procedure

## ‚úÖ **ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION: Chains Batch Save**

### **sp_batch_save_forecasts_chains.sql Updates**
- ‚úÖ **Running Table Behavior (FR-004)** - Updated procedure to handle chains table without `FORECAST_GENERATION_MONTH_DATE` field
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Documentation** - Added comprehensive comments explaining running table behavior
- ‚úÖ **Publication Check Logic** - Maintains market publication validation while respecting running table design
- ‚úÖ **Primary Method Handling** - Correctly updates chains primary forecast method table (also running table)

**Key Change:** Procedure now correctly handles that chains manual input represents current state only, not locked to specific forecast generation cycles.
